# Zodiac's Finale 
### [ Solar Longitude = 358° ]

---

## 🌌 Background
In the celestial mechanics of the ecliptic, **358°** represents the final stillness before the cycle resets. As the sun nears the **Vernal Equinox (0°)**, the old narrative concludes, and the world prepares for a total rebirth. 

This project, **Zodiac's Finale**, is a sonic observation of this transition—the quiet, reflective bridge between the ultimate completion and the dawn of a new spring.

## 🕊 Motivation
This repository is a digital archive of a specific frequency. 

As the wheel turns and the sun crosses into the new season, this melody stands as a silent observer. It carries a simple wish: **that as all things revive and flourish with the coming of spring, joy and vitality may find their way into every coordinate of the universe.**

May the music remain as a constant, echoing the silent growth of everything anew.
